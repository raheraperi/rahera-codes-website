      Kia ora! I&#8217;m Rachael, a full-stack web developer and Te Uru Rangi Māori scholarship graduate
      of Enspiral Dev Academy, New Zealand&#8217;s premiere school for web development.
      </h3>
      <p>
      Since graduating from Victoria University of Wellington,
      my main focus was on socially impactful work in local government. I gained a unique insight into the needs
      of our communities, which fuelled an existing desire within me to make a positive impact in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
      I craved a career path that focused on innovative, creative and dynamic problem-solving, and started
      my pursuit of a career in tech. In March 2018, after being fortunate enough to receive a Te Uru Rangi
      Māori Scholarship, I started my studies at Enspiral Dev Academy.
      </p>
      <p>
      As an Enspiral Dev Academy graduate, I’m looking for opportunities to combine my passion for people,
      creativity and tech-based solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
      When not online, you can find me in Auckland, New Zealand - probably having a lovely zen time
      practicing yoga or on a bush walk.
