      <h2>A little about my experience</h2>
      <p>
      Starting my career in the public sector, I was able to gain a unique insight into the needs
      of communities of Tāmaki Makaurau, fuelling an existing desire inside me to become a
      change-maker and force for good. I understood the limits of my impact in local government and
      decided to embark on a journey into the tech world. </p>
      <p>
      I commenced my studies in Web Development through NZs Premiere school for web development
      - Enspiral Dev Academy in March 2018 after being fortunate to receive a Te Uru Rangi Māori
      Scholarship. I am very interested in blockchain and de-centralised technology and its
      applications in socially and environmentally impactful work.
